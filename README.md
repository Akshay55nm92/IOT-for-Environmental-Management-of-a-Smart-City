# Problem Overview

- ###### Environmental pollution has existed for centuries but started to be more significant in recent times. There are environmental crisis in almost all the cities of the world. 
- ###### Pollution must be taken seriously, as it has a negative effect on natural elements that are an absolute need for life to exist on earth, such as water and air. 
- ###### So we need better ways to manage it and inform the citizens and the concerned environment officials about the crisis at the earliest, so that it can be managed before the situation gets out of hand

# Opportunity

- ###### Considering the Problem statement, Sensors could be brought in use to look into the exceeding pollution levels in Environment.
- ###### Sensors can turn out to be very effective to detect the threshold level of the harmful elements present in Air, the increase in decibel level in noise, increase in waste in garbage bins and increase in water level for flood alerts.
- ###### Since the sensors can communicate with each other, we need to take advantage of that and automate the manual process.
- ###### Sensors could be used to convey the detected pollution in environment to sensor board and unique feature of work request in Ecosytem model can be used to improve the condition of environment.

# Purpose

- ###### The purpose of this project is to help in the environment management by tracking the Air Quality Index, Flood Alert Level, Increase Noise decibels and waste in garbage with the help of sensors.
- ###### Air Quality index (AQI) will be sensed by the sensor placed in open air and reading of all the sensor will be available with sensor management department and as soon as they get AQI above than threshold they will send it solution department for solution.
- ###### Similarly for case of flood Alert, sensors will be placed in rivers and reading will be taken. If the reading is increased above the threshold than concerning solution department will be notified by work request.
- ###### In case of Noise pollution the sensors placed in specific zipcode will take the reading of noise in the environment and report it to sensor management department which will check for areas above certain threshold of decibels in noise and further report it to solution department.
- ###### For Garbage pollution,Sensors will be placed in the bins and when the level goes above threshold value, the concerned solution department will be notified to clear the bins.

# Application Key Functionalities
- ###### In our Application model, we are using IOT technology to send work requests to the concerned environmental officials from the sensors.Simultaneously ,we are also sending notifications to the citizens about certain scenarios.We are primarily taking 4 factors into consideration which are as follows :

    ###### 1. GARBAGE MANAGEMENT IN A CITY

    ###### 2. AIR POLLUTION MANAGEMENT IN A CITY

    ###### 3. FLOOD AND RIVER POLLUTION MANAGEMENT IN A CITY

    ###### 4. NOISE POLLUTION MANAGEMENT IN A CITY
